/* 
 Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables).
 This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

 The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0).

 ==	  Equal to
 !=	  Not equal
 >	  Greater than
 <	  Less than
 >=	  Greater than or equal to
 <=	  Less than or equal to

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x = 9;
  int y = 4;
  cout << (x > y); // returns 1 (true) because 9 is greater than 4
  return 0;
}
